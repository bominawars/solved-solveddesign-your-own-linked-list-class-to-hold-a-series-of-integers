Design your own linked list class to hold a series of integers. The class should have member functions for appending, inserting, and deleting nodes. Don’t forget to add a destructor that destroys the list. Demonstrate the class with a driver program.

Modify the linked list class you created to add a ‘print’ member function. The function should display all the values in the linked list. Test the class by starting with an empty list, adding some elements, and then printing the resulting list out.
